# linebot-template

A template to build LINE Bot extremely fastüöÄ

# What's this? ü§î

This is a tiny LINE Bot project template with these features below:

- Multi-skills and Multi-turns support (Context based routing)
- Scalable (Very essential)
- Continuous improvement support (Message logs)

# Quick Start

First of all, download or clone this repository and install dependencies. Run this command on the of project directory.

NOTE: You can change the directory name as you like before installing dependencies.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Next, put your ChannelAccessToken and ChannelSecret in `config.ini`. You can also change `[DATABASE] > connection_string` now or later.

```ini
[LINE_API]
channel_access_token = YOUR_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN
channel_secret = YOUR_CHANNEL_SECRET

[DATABASE]
connection_string = sqlite:///linebot.db
```

Okay everything is done! Run `run.py` to start your bot.

```bash
$ python run.py
```

Don't forget to expose the webhook endpoint to the Internet with Ngrok or something if you runs bot on your PC, and put the given URL to LINE Developers.

```bash
$ ngrok http 12345
```

I have one more thing to introduce to you. Access http://localhost:12345/admin/messagelog . You can see the conversation histories on your browser. This is a very powerful tool that helps you to monitor your chatbot is working as you expected and to debug with rich information.

# Building your chatbot

Before start building you may want to know the architecture of this template, don't you? Okay, see the diagram below.

![linebot-template Architecture Overview](https://uezo.blob.core.windows.net/github/linebot-template/linebot-template-architecture.png)

In short, just implementing `YourBot.extract_intent` and `YourSkill(s).process_request` are needed to create your chatbot. Any other common features are ready as out of the box.

## Echo bot

This is the simplest example for the bot that has only EchoSkill.

```python
from botframework import SkillBase
from botframework.channels.line import LineBotBase

class EchoSkill(SkillBase):
    # configure topic name of this skill
    topic = "Echo"

    def process_request(self, request, user, context):
        # return what user said
        return request.event.message.text

class EchoBot(LineBotBase):
    # register skills that will be used in this bot
    skills = [EchoSkill]

    def extract_intent(self, request, user, context):
        # trigger EchoSkill everytime
        return EchoSkill.topic
```

## Multi-turn echo bot

If you want to continue topic and keep context next turn, set `end_session=False` to the response from your skill. This is the example of multi-turn echo, that shows current input and last input.

```python
from botframework import SkillBase
from botframework.channels.line import LineBotBase, LineResponse

class MultiTurnEchoSkill(SkillBase):
    topic = "MultiTurnEcho"

    def process_request(self, request, user, context):
        current_text = request.event.message.text
        last_text = context.data.get("last_text")
        context.data["last_text"] = current_text

        message = f"Current input: {current_text}"
        if last_text:
            message += f"\nLast input: {last_text}"

        return LineResponse(
            messages=message,
            end_session=False   # üëà Add param not to clear context after this turn
        )

class MultiTurnEchoBot(LineBotBase):
    skills = [MultiTurnEchoSkill]

    def extract_intent(self, request, user, context):
        if not context.topic:   # üëà Add condition not to trigger topic newly when the context is alive
            return MultiTurnEchoSkill.topic
```

# Lifecycle of context

Context is always cleared every turn by default but is kept as long as `end_session=False` is set to Response in your skill.

It will be cleared when:

- `end_session=True` is set to Response in your skill (by default, True is set)
- Timed out. 300 seconds after last update by default
- Intent bound to topic(skill) is extracted regardless that the topic is changed or not
- Exception is caught in `BotBase.process_events`


# Mute MessageLog

In case you don't want to save some data in message log for performance or security reasons, you can mute specific columns by using your own MessageLog class.

```python
class MyMessageLog(MessageLog):
    @property
    def context_on_start(self):
        super().context_on_start()

    # override not to set serialized value
    @context_on_start.setter
    def context_on_start(self, value):
        self.__context_on_start = None

class MyBot(LineBotBase):
    # Use custom message log class
    message_log_class = MyMessageLog
        : (ÁúÅÁï•)
```
